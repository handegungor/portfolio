    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Hande and I'm a newly qualified junior developer who is very eager to explore the world of coding! I'm from Istanbul, the city of 7 hills and 2 continents and countless beautiful places. I grew up in Germany but also lived in Zurich. Fate has brought me to Manchester, UK and this is the place that I call my second home now.</p>
    <p>How did I get interested in coding? </p> 
    <p>To give it a bit of context; Turkish is my native language. I learned German and English simultaneously when I was a kid and can speak both fluently. After speaking 3 languages I thought why not add another one to the list?</p>
    <p>I was always fascinated by coding but my real interest started when I was enquiring about how to build my own website. I decided to take the course with Manchester Codes and it was the best decision ever! Now after completing the course I can't wait to get stuck into the world of coding and continue to learn something new and exciting every day!</p>
